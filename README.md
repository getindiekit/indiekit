[Indiekit](https://getindiekit.com) is a small but powerful server that acts as the go-between your website and the wider independent web.

* Publish content to your website using apps like [iAWriter](https://ia.net/writer), [Micro.blog](https://micro.blog), [Icro](https://hartl.co/apps/icro/), [Indigenous](https://indigenous.realize.be) or services that support the [Micropub API](https://micropub.spec.indieweb.org)

* Syndicate your content to social networks like Twitter, ~~Mastodon and LinkedIn~~, and save posts to the Internet Archive

* ~~Accept likes, comments and other types of feedback on your content with Webmention~~

* Save files to different content stores such as Bitbucket, GitHub, GitLab and Gitea

* Highly configurable, with presets available for common static site generators such as Jekyll and Hugo.

* Localisable, with initial support for English, French and German.

Learn how to [set up an Indiekit server](https://getindiekit.com/docs/getting-started/) and view an [example server configuration](https://github.com/paulrobertlloyd/paulrobertlloyd-indiekit/blob/main/index.js).

## Demo

If you want to see how Indiekit works, deploy this application to Heroku.

> This assumes you’ll be saving files to GitHub and publishing to a Jekyll (or similar) static site generator.

Clicking the button below will guide you through the process.

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/getindiekit/indiekit/tree/main)

You’ll be asked to provide the following values:

* `GITHUB_TOKEN` - A GitHub [personal access token](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
* `GITHUB_USER` - Your username on GitHub
* `GITHUB_REPO` - Name of the repository where you want to save files
* `PUBLICATION_URL` - URL of the website you want to publish to

## Local development

```sh
npm start
```

If you’re developing a new feature, and want the application to automatically restart whenever a file change is detected, use `npm run dev`.

### Testing

```sh
npm test
```

The following environment variables need to be set before running tests:

* `TEST_PUBLICATION_URL`
* `TEST_BEARER_TOKEN`
* `TEST_BEARER_TOKEN_NOSCOPE`

`TEST_BEARER_TOKEN` and `TEST_BEARER_TOKEN_NOSCOPE` provide IndieAuth access tokens whose `me` value matches that set in `TEST_PUBLICATION_URL`.`TEST_BEARER_TOKEN` should provide scoped permissions `create update delete`, whereas `TEST_BEARER_TOKEN_NOSCOPE` should provide no permissions at all.

[Homebrew Access Token](https://gimme-a-token.5eb.nl) is a useful tool for creating access tokens for this purpose.
