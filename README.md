[Indiekit](https://getindiekit.com) is a small but powerful server that acts as the go-between your website and the wider independent web.

- Publish content to your website using apps like [iAWriter](https://ia.net/writer), [Micro.blog](https://micro.blog), [Icro](https://hartl.co/apps/icro/), [Indigenous](https://indigenous.realize.be) or services that support the [Micropub API](https://micropub.spec.indieweb.org)

- Syndicate your content to social networks like Twitter and Mastodon, and save posts to the Internet Archive

- ~~Accept likes, comments and other types of feedback on your content with Webmention~~

- Save files to different content stores such as Bitbucket, GitHub, GitLab and Gitea

- Highly configurable, with presets available for common static site generators such as Jekyll and Hugo.

- Localisable, with initial support for English, Dutch, French, German and Portuguese.

Learn how to [set up an Indiekit server](https://getindiekit.com/get-started/) and view an [example server configuration](https://github.com/paulrobertlloyd/paulrobertlloyd-indiekit/blob/main/index.js).

## Local development

If youâ€™re developing a new feature, and want the application to automatically restart whenever a file change is detected, use the following command:

```sh
npm run dev
```

The application will run locally using HTTPS. This requires `localhost.pem` and `localhost-key.pem` files in the root folder of the project. These can be [created using the `mkcert` utility](https://web.dev/how-to-use-local-https/).

### Testing

```sh
npm test
```

The following environment variables need to be set before running tests:

- `TEST_TOKEN`
- `TEST_TOKEN_CREATE_SCOPE`
- `TEST_TOKEN_NO_SCOPE`
- `TEST_PUBLICATION_URL`
- `TEST_SESSION_SECRET`

`TEST_TOKEN`, `TEST_TOKEN_CREATE_SCOPE` and `TEST_TOKEN_NO_SCOPE` provide IndieAuth access tokens whose `me` value matches that set in `TEST_PUBLICATION_URL`.`TEST_TOKEN` should provide scope for `create update delete`, `TEST_TOKEN` should provide scope for `create` and `TEST_TOKEN_NO_SCOPE` should provide no scope at all.

[Homebrew Access Token](https://gimme-a-token.5eb.nl) is a useful tool for creating access tokens for this purpose.

## Decisions

Architectural decisions made on this project are documented using Architecture Decision Records, as [described by Michael Nygard](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions). These can be found in `/docs/decisions`.
