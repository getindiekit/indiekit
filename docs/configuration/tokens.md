# Tokens

Values for post and media paths in post type configuration can be customised using placeholder tokens.

For example, given the following properties for a note post:

```js
{
  published: "2020-02-02",
  name: "What I had for lunch",
  content: "I ate a cheese sandwich, which was nice.",
}
```

would, with the path `_journal/{yyyy}-{MM}-{dd}-{slug}.md`, output:

```txt
_journal/2020-02-02-what-i-had-for-lunch.md
```
