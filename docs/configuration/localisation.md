# Localisation

## Change the application’s locale

Indiekit has been localised into the following languages:

- `en`: US English
- `de`: Deutsch (with contributions from [Andreas Fink](https://github.com/AFink))
- `es`: Español (with contributions from [Anthony Ciccarello](https://github.com/aciccarello))
- `es-419`: Español (Latin American Spanish, with contributions from Claudia Botero)
- `fr`: Français (with contributions from David Legrand)
- `id`: bahasa Indonesia (with contributions from Zeky Chandra)
- `nl`: Nederlands
- `pl`: Polski (with contributions from Arookei The Wolf)
- `pt`: Português
- `sr`: Srpski (with contributions from Anđela Radojlović)
- `zh-Hans-CN`: 中文 (Simplified Chinese, with contributions from [Xie Yanbo](https://github.com/xyb) and [藍](https://github.com/kwaa))

You can change the application’s locale by changing the `application.locale` option, for example:

```json
{
  "application": {
    "locale": "de"
  }
}
```
