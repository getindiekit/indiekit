*An IndieWeb publishing toolkit*

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paulrobertlloyd/indiekit/master/app/static/logo.svg?sanitize=true)

The immediate goal of this project is to provide a [Micropub](https://www.w3.org/TR/micropub/) endpoint that can be hosted on a service like Heroku, configured via files stored on a GitHub repo, and save posts back to that repo for publishing with a static site generator like [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) or [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.io). The software is [fully documented](https://paulrobertlloyd.github.io/indiekit/app) and tested.

A long term ambition is to build a tool that supports different publishing destinations, other social publishing specifications (Webmention, Microsub, ActivityPub etc.) and integrates with a range of content management systems.

This tool is inspired by [similar projects](https://paulrobertlloyd.github.io/indiekit/projects) made by members of the [IndieWeb community](https://indieweb.org).
