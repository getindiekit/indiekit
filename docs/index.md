The immediate goal of this project is to provide a [Micropub](https://www.w3.org/TR/micropub/) endpoint that can be hosted on a service like Heroku and configured via files stored on a GitHub repo. All aspects of the software will be [fully documented](https://paulrobertlloyd.github.io/indiekit/docs) and tested, including tests that simulate those provided by the [Micropub Rocks!](https://micropub.rocks) validator.

A longer term ambition is to build a tool that supports more publishing destintions, other social publishing specifications (Webmention, Microsub, ActivityPub etc.) and integrates with a range of content management systems.
