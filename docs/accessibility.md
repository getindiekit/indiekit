# Accessibility statement

Indiekit aims to provide an application interface and documentation website that is accessible to all.

## Compliance status

The application interface and this website are partially compliant with the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) AA standard due to the non-compliances listed below.

### Application interface

There are no known accessibility issues in the application interface.

### Documentation website

This documentation website is built with [VitePress](https://vitepress.vuejs.org).

Items listed below are currently not accessible or may present issues with accessibility software:

* **Search:** If JavaScript is disabled or unavailable, a search button is shown in the navigation bar, but no search input is displayed. ([VitePress issue #1794](https://github.com/vuejs/vitepress/issues/1794))

## Preparation of this statement

This statement was prepared on 20 July 2023. A self-assessment was carried out on both the website and application interface.

## Feedback

I’m always looking to improve the accessibility of Indiekit and its documentation. If you find any problems not listed on this page, or think it’s not meeting accessibility requirements, [submit a new issue on GitHub](https://github.com/getindiekit/indiekit/issues/new/choose).
