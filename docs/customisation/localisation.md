# Localisation

## Change the application’s locale

Indiekit has been localised into the following languages:

* `en`: US English
* `de`: Deutsch (with contributions from [Andreas Fink](https://github.com/AFink))
* `fr`: Français (with contributions from David Legrand)
* `nl`: Nederlands
* `pt`: Português

You can change the application’s locale by changing the `application.locale` option, for example:

```js
indiekit.set('application.locale', 'de');
```

## Contribute a new localisation

Localisations are managed using Localazy. If you see a translation that is not quite right, or would like to add support for a new language, create an account and [contribute to the project](https://localazy.com/p/indiekit).
